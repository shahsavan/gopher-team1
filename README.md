## Introduction

This repository serves as a collaborative space for developers to enhance their skills in Go. Each developer will create a separate branch to work on their personal projects, allowing for individual exploration while contributing to a collective learning environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-training-projects.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your project:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
4. **Start coding!** Add your Go files and any additional resources you need.
5. **Commit your changes** and push them to your branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

## Branching Strategy

Each developer should create a branch named after themselves or their project. For example:

- `john-doe/project-name`
- `jane-smith/awesome-go-app`

This helps keep everyone's work organized and easily identifiable.
